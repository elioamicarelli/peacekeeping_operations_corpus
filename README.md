# ðŸ¦š About this repo ðŸ¦š

This is a public repo for the peacekeeping operations corpus (PKOC). Here you can find the code and documentation needed to create the corpus from scratch as well as the data already cooked for you as described in ["Amicarelli, Elio and Di Salvatore, Jessica, Introducing the PeaceKeeping Operations Corpus (PKOC)".](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3530404)

- In the document *documentation/PKOC0A03.pdf* you will find the PKOC functions' documentation as well as important info on how you should set up your local environment to succesfully execute the corpus creation workflow. Read this file.

- The code needed to create the corpus from scratch is in *main/PKOC_main.py* (Python 3). At the very end of this file there is a commented section showing the entire workflow for the corpus creation.

- The data can be downloaded from https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/pkoc. There you will find three pickle files containing python dictiories for the  plain, tagged and reduced version of PKOC (see our paper for details). If you want to cook the data by yourself we also share the all the reports converted to txt.

Contributions to this project are very welcome!!!

Notes:

- The last update of the shared data is June 2020.
