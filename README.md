# About this repo

This is a public repo for the peacekeeping operations corpus (PKOC). Here you can find the code and documentation needed to create the peacekeeping operations corpus described in ["Introducing the PeaceKeeping Operations Corpus (PKOC)".](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3530404)

- In the document *documentation/PKOC0A03.pdf* you will find the PKOC functions' documentation.

- The code is in *main/PKOC_main.py* (Python 3). At the very end of this file there is a commented section showing the entire workflow for the corpus creation.
