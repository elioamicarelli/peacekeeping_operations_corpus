# About this repo

This is a public repo for the peacekeeping operations corpus (PKOC). Here you can find the code and documentation needed to create the peacekeeping operations corpus as well as the data described in ["Introducing the PeaceKeeping Operations Corpus (PKOC)".](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3530404).

- In the document *documentation/PKOC0A03.pdf* you will find the PKOC functions' documentation and how you should set up your local environment to succesfully execure the corpus creation workflow. Read this file.

- The code is in *main/PKOC_main.py* (Python 3). At the very end of this file there is a commented section showing the entire workflow for the corpus creation.

- In the *data* folder you can find three pickle files containing the plain, tagged and reduced version of PKOC (see our paper for details). The corporta are  python dictionaries. In the same folder you will also find the raw corpus txt files.
